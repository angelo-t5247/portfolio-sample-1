            <h1>Hi, Thanks for visiting my site.</h1>
            <p>With a few months of experience learning to code is really an amazing journey.
            Pursuing a career in software development did not came to my mind after only a few years
            ago when a co-worker of mine have told me about about being an associate software engineer
            and I got interested. Then that's when it started.</p>
            <p>As of now, I was able to learn the different technologies used in Java and
            the database as well. My goal now is to create Java applications using
            Spring framework and after that learn frontend development as well.</p>
